# Task

The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 8 = 0, and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

## Answer

Regression line of y on x.

   3x + 4y + 8 = 0

   <=>  4y = -3x - 8
   <=>   y = (-3/4)x - 2

   p = (-3/4) sd(y) / sd(x)

Regression line of x on y

   4x + 3y + 7 = 0

   <=> 4x = -3y - 7
   <=>  x = (-3/4)y - 7/4

   p = (-3/4) sd(x) / sd(y)

Hence,

   p^2 = (-3/4) (sd(y) / sd(x))  (-3/4) (sd(x) / sd(y))

   <=> p^2 = (-3/4) (-3/4) 
   <=> p^2 = 9/16

   Since p < 0, p = -3/4
